# Revise C Coding

If you have not coded in C for a while, try doing these excercises to jog your memory.

1) Reverse an array. Compare your implementation with [this solution](./001-reverse-array.c).

1) [Find the Symmetric Difference](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/algorithms/find-the-symmetric-difference) - Write a function that accepts two arrays (of int) and returns an array that has the symmetric difference of the two input arrays. Compare your implementation with [this solution](./008-sym-diff.c).

2) Write a function that allocates an array of passed size and retruns it back to the caller. Compare your implementation with [this solution](./002-dynamic-array.c).

3) Compare and update the inventory stored in an array against a second array of a fresh delivery. Compare your implementation with [this solution](./003-struct.c).

1) Palindrome.  Compare your implementation with [this solution](./010-palindrome.c).
